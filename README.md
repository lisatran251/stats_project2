# Predicting Cancer related Malignant Cell Growth (Stats Project) 

## Study Goal 
The goal of this analysis was to determine the best model for detecting breast cancer using 30 predictor variables. A series of machine learning models were used on the training dataset and cross-validated using the testing dataset. For this classification problem, the models predict, based on the predictors from the testing dataset, if the cancer is malignant (M) or benign (B). Accuracy, Specificity and Sensitivity metrics are used to determine model performance and to compare which model best predicts the outcome. 

## Test Applied 
- Elastic Net 
- KNN
- Classification Tree (CART)
- Support vector machine 
- A bagged version of CART
- Random forest
